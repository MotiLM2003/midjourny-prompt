--- PARAMETERS ---
8k:	Lighting tends to be more extreme; colors even more saturated and computer-generated looking than "high definition"
cinematic:	Shadows tend to be more extreme (though not darker); objects a bit thicker; more poster-like
high definition	Shadows are lightened; more fanciful and saturated colors
ultra photorealistic:	Similar to "fine ultra-detailed realistic"
Hasselblad H6D	Sharper: focus on subject; shadows are deepened
fine ultra-detailed realistic:	Can be a bit grainy and "ropey" but increases detail generation
color grading	Extreme variations in hue; vibrant but not over-saturated colors
depth of field:	Sharp focus on subject, background and foreground blurred
film lighting:	Limited lighting sources; backlighting common; deep shadows cast by light sources
rim lighting:	Slightly stronger lighting effect than "film lighting," but very similar results
intricate:	Tends toward non-realistic "crafts" and "pattern" type designs.
realism	Artistic: realism. Backgrounds tend to be more uniform; subject looks more like a painting; more objects with subject
photography:	Subject tends to have a little area of objects around it with little else in the background
rendered for IMAX:	More complex subject with very directional lighting and subdued saturation
tilt-shift:	Like "depth of field," but from above or with high angle
motion-blur:	Speed lines. May render as if wind is blowing
35mm film:	More vibrant colors, but muted saturation, detailed with additional foreground and/or background elements




here are some other propties you can use at thhe end of the prompt to improve it.  examples:
--weird accepts values: 0‚Äì3000.
--aspect or --ar: description: "Change the aspect ratio of a generation. Eg: --ar 2:3
--ar 1:1 description: "Default aspect ratio.
--ar 5:4 description: "Common frame and print ratio.
--ar 3:2 description: "Common in print photography.
--ar 7:4  - description: "Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens."
--chaos: values 1-100, example : "--chaos 50", description: Using a higher --chaos value will produce initial image grids that are more varied and unexpected each time a Job is run.

--no: Negative prompting, remove plants from the image.
--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2> or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2>: How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.
--stylize <number> or --s <number>: Parameter influences how strongly Midjourney‚Äôs default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.
--uplight: Use an alternative ‚Äúlight‚Äù upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.
--upbeta: Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.
